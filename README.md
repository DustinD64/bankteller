## Instructions
### Setup
- Clone the repository into your editor

### Running
- Open a terminal at the root of the project `bankteller`
- Run the command `mvn spring-book:run`

## Features
Each feature will need to be submitted with a PR of your feature branch implementing the new functionality.  The feature will be given tasks that will touch on new concepts.


### Feature 1: Depositing
#### Assignment
Add the ability for the user to deposit money with another command
#### Purpose
This will test working with multiple classes, data validation, language syntax, constants and getting used to navigating a small project
#### Notes
- We will assume there is a single account
- The only functionatliy so far is to view the account balance



### Feature 2: Withdraw and Multi Accounts
#### Assignment
- Add the ability for the user to take money out of their account
- Allow multiple users to maintain an account at our bank
#### Purpose
This will test working with choosing data structures for the use case and increating error handling
#### Notes
- Allow for another input for an account identifier
- The account identifier can be anything of your choosing but numeric ids are traditionally leveraged
- The data structure will need to be initialized for now in code as it does not persist to disk
- Load a few accounts into the data structure manually as the next feature will work with creating new class/interface for that purpose
